In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can
execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given
a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of
operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
1. Prototype: def minOperations(n)
2. Returns an integer
3. If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
